.title File Manager

The File Manager is the main Navigator window for working with files.
With its help the majority of the file-operations can be performed in
Navigator. The File Manager window is created by choosing Manager|New
from the menubar.
After this, Navigator asks you the drive letter, with which you want to
work, and after you have chosen one, you will see the window with two
file panels.
You can set file panel options by selecting them from the Manager
menu.

The various items of the File Manager window are:
  - {File panel:FilePanel} - Main panel of the File Manager
  - {Directory tree:DirTree}
  - {Information panel:_}
  - {Quick view panel:_}
  - {Temp and Find disk :TempList}

; /portions by Deleter/  Feb 2003

These commands are accessible from the Manager menu. They can be used
to configure the Manager window for the users needs.

{New:_} - Opens a new Manager window

{Directory tree:_} - If there is no active {directory tree:DirTree},
it pops up in the inactive panel, and in case of its presence - the
tree is removed from the window.

{Info:_} - The same applies to the Info screen. It shows some info
about the disk.

{Quick view:_} - The same for the Quick View panel. It lets you view a
highlighted file.

{Swap panels:_} - Swap location of the panels.

{Show/hide left panel:_} - Shows/Hides left Manager panel.

{Show/hide right panel:_} - Shows/Hides right Manager panel.

{Show/hide inactive panel:_}


{Change drive left:_} - Change disk of left panel without activating
it. If the panel was not visible, it becomes visible after choosing
a disk.

{Change drive right:_} - The same for the right panel.

.title Work with windows

Navigator is a multi-windowed environment, therefore many unexperienced
users may have some difficulties with working with Navigator.
The other users can simply ignore multi-windowed interface, thus
losing the set of convinient opportunities and time.
Besides, the fact that this multi-windowed system is easy and pleasant,
all windows have the same 'appearance' ({"Types of windows":WindowsType},
so you can learn how to work with Navigator quickly. You can switch
between windows using the mouse or commands {Window|Next:_} and {Window|Previous:_}
(all window-manipulating commands have hotkeys).
The window can be closed by the command Window|Close. With help of
{Window|Zoom:_} command it is possible to maximize the window to the size of whole
screen, as well as to return it to previous size.

The list of currently opened windows, is available with {Window|List:_}.

The size and location of a window can be changed with help of a mouse, or
through the command {Window|Size/Move:_}. When that command is chosen,
moving the window is possible with the arrows     , while changing
of its size can be done with the same arrows, together with <Shift>.

The user can re-arrange the windows on the screen choosing "cascade"
({Window|Cascade:_}) or "tile" ({Window|Tile:_}).

.title Erasing of files
; /portions by Deleter/ 07.02.2003

Navigator allows you to delete the files and directories, which are not
empty. This is possible with the command File|Delete.

When trying to erase a non-empty directory Navigator will prompt you
about that:

If you simply "automatically" press ENTER, nothing will take place.

In case you are erasing several not empty directories and You are
sure, that want to erase them, you can press "All", and the
confirmation will not be repeated.

Note that you can switch any confirmations of in Options|Configuration|Confirmations
dialog box. We do not reccomend it, unless are pretty sure that you will not
press erase hotkey accidently...


.topic SplitFiles=26
.title Split file to multiple volumes

Dos Navigator can split very large files to several parts a-la DOS Backup.
The main difference between backup and DN-split is that DN does not erase
the contents of the disk, but it only uses free disk space. To split or
Combine a file choose the command File|Split/Combine.

While splitting a file, DN is creating files with extensions ".d??",
where ?? represents the number of the volume. When combining these
files, Navigator distinguishes created volumes using extensions
and internal format.

 WARNING: Files, splitted on multiple volumes with Navigator can
          only be restored by Navigator! If you don't want to
          use DN for merging volumes you should use `Binary
          splitting only' option in Spli dialog box.

Navigator allows to copy both files and directories with its contents.
This can be done with the command File|Copy, when a file panel of
File Manager is active.

Moving of files and directories is done by the command File|{Rename/Move:RenameMove}.
It is executed within the limits of one disk, as from disk on disk.

When copying, Navigator can use system 'copy' function if
`Advanced copy' option is switched on in System Setup dialog box.

.title Append files

Merging files is copying two or more files to one file.
This can be done by choosing the copy command, and then enabling the
option "Append to all existing files" in the dialog box or, when
Navigator asks you if it should overwrite an existing file, you choose
the button "Append". (That question will be repeated every time an
existing file will be overwritten, if a group of files is copied.)

.title Text editor

Navigator's internal text-editor is intended for already existing
files, and for creating new text-files. The commands used by the
internal editor, are a little different from Word Star's commands.
The main difference consists in working with blocks of text- it is
like the editors from Microsoft Corporation(R), where it is executed
through the Clipboard.

In Navigator, more than one editor window can be opened at a time.
You can use as many windows as you want, as long as they all fit
in your computer's memory.
To exchange data between them, the same Clipboard used.

There is a small, but in the authors opinion pleasant, feature to work with
in the internal editor: if you press the right mouse button, a
line with numbers appears, that moves together with the mouse cursor within
the borders of the window.

Another feature of the editor is multilevel undo.

.title File Panel

File panel is the main panel of the File Manager. It gives the user the
opportunity to work with files and directories and to perform operations
on groups of files and/or directories. The user can change the parameters
for each panel using the command Panel|Setup Panel, with ALT-S.

To tag (or untag) files for group operations use the Insert key or,
for tagging files using a mask, the command Panel|Select Group
(Panel|Unselect Group to untag) is used. If you want, that the
tagged files become not untagged and the untagged become tagged, use the
command Panel|Invert Selection.

Note: marking of directories must be done manually.

Panel|Make list file command is used whenever you want to create a list
of currently marked files.

.title Start of files on extensions

When the user is in the file panel, it would be handy if DN would start a
certain program depending on the extension of the current file. DN makes it
possible!

It is ossible to start not just one command but a complete list of
commands or to call a menu for choosing several options.
That could be done with the Extension file - the file describing how to
work with particular filetypes, determined by the extension.

To start a certain command, you just move the cursor to
the file you want, and use one of the following key combinations:
   Enter, Shift-Enter or Alt-Enter.
When you press the last combination, the menu will appear.

To describe the commands for each extension, you choose the

Options|Extension file edit menu option.
The format of each entry in the file being edited is following:

 ??? <the opening symbol>...
                          DOS command or
                          {menu description:MenuFormat} (for Alt-Enter)
                          ... <the closing symbol>

Here ??? is a particular extension, opening and closing symbols should
correspond to one of the following combinations:
     Enter - '/' and '/',
     Shift-Enter - '(' and ')'   and
     Alt-Enter - '[' and ']'

If you want to use the filename in your command, insert a '!',
name with extension - '!.!', directory of file - '!\'.
To indicate the symbol '!', use '!!'.

A fragment of the file of extensions:

 Asm{{    @echo off
         echo $[1;36;40m[J[1;36;44m

DN windows are the working areas of program containing necessary information.
All sets (large enough) of DN windows is possible to separate on two large
groups: working windows and dialog boxes. The main distinction between
them is that it is possible to have several working windows of the same
type on the Desktop and to switch between them, while only one dialog box
can be active at any moment and there is no possibility to switch to
other windows when a dialog is active.

The dialog boxes are intended first of all for entering Navigator
settings, parameters of various operations such as file copying,
formatting of flexible disks or unerasing of erased files and some
other functions (for example, viewing Memo field in Database viewer).

File Manager, File Viewer and File Editor windows are examples of working
windows.

The files those are not to think of or which are usually
erased (black color):

   BAK;$$$;SWP

The working files of programs, texts, documentation, i.e. the most frequently
edited files (green color pleasant for eyes):

   TXT;DOC;BAS;FOR;C;CPP;ASM;INC

Multimedia (graphics, music) - blue color:

   PIC;GIF;PCX;TIF;IMG;STM;CDM;MOD;SND

The files those are generally not to work directly with, which should not attract
attention (pleasant for eye dark-green color):

   PRJ;OBJ;LST;DBF;WKS;123

The files of which should attract user's attention, which should be
processed at once (very appreciable, but not irritant magenta color):

when searching for text since you want to open, read, and
search as few large files as possible. It also makes it
possible to round up all files a certain age, size, or with a
certain {file attribute:FileAttr}.

The criteria selected is used the next time you start a search. The
Find File main dialog box shows "Advanced Search is ON" to remind
you that you are filtering the files.

Date is after: Input a file date and (optionally) time
  formatted as: mm-dd-yy [hh:mm] [AM | PM]]. For instance:
  5-10-90 or 15-1-89 7:0 am. Only files which have been
  modified after that date and time will be included in the
  search.
Date is before: Only files which were last modified before the
  input date and time will be included in the search.

Size is greater than / less than: Input a range of sizes. You
  may use K or M at the end; for instance, 2000 is about the
  same as 2K.

The check boxes let you include only files with a specific
combination of {file attributes:FileAttr}. For instance, tick the
Archive bit is set control if the file you want has been
created/modified since you last backed up.

.title User menu

Navigator allows the user to create a menu for calling external programs
and DOS-commands. It is stored in the file DN.MNU. When you call the command
Utilities|User menu, Navigator checks for this file in the current
directory, and, if it finds the file, it starts a menu from the directory,
which has the Navigator files.

Creation and editing global (i.e. accessible from any directory) user
menu is done with help of the command Options|Global menu definition. The
local menu for each directory can be edited, by choosing
Options|Local menu definition.

When the user chooses any menu command, then, if it was not the header of
the following menu level, Navigator creates a temporary .BAT file with
two parameters: First the name of the file on which the cursor was on,
and second the name of a file-list of files marked in this panel.

 {Hints:_}: ˛ If User menu not found in current directory, DN will
          find out User menu in upper directories.
        ˛ It is possible to switch between Local/Global User Menu
          while User Menu is executed.
        ˛ It is possible to start edit User Menu after call to it.

.title Format of the user menu file

The user menu in Navigator has a very simple structure.
Each item of this menu begins with the symbol {'>':_}, after which the level
of this item in hierarchy of menu follows.

Followed by a blank and the name of this item. In the name, it is possible

to enclose a character in {'~':_}, after pressing which, it is possible
to cause this user command without using the arrows. The following lines
contain the list of commands.

Here, {"%1":_} is the name of a file-list of files marked in active file
panel (use {"%2":_} to get file-list from passive file panel). The next
menu item begins with the symbol {'>':_}.

For creating the next menu level it is necessary to increase the number
of the level of this item with 1 in comparison with the previous and all
menu elements of this level.

  You can need to edit or add new environment variables. Often you need to
change PATH or, say, BLASTER.

  In the center of the window you see all variables list, one of them is
highlighted by cursor. The variable's value is shown in the bottom line.
There you can edit this value. To add/edit/renam environment variables you
can use the buttons in the right side of the window.

WARNING: While the length of environment variable value in DN/2 is limited to
255 characters (it works for 1.51.10b11 and lower; for newer versions see
whatsnew.txt), when you press OK button, all longer variables are cut to 255

 {Delete:_} - delete of file from current list
 {Close:_} - leave from regime of background printing
 {Pause:_} - pause of printing of current file. If the printer is not ready for
operation, automatically the printing is suspended.

.topic CountrySetup=16564
.title Country support
This panel is designed for settings specific to country and language.

The group of settings in upper part of the dialog usually does not
require manual correction. These values are requested from operating
system when DN is started for the first time.  However one can change
them if necessary.
To request this array of values from system again one can press the
button {System:_}. The uppercase table setup that existed in previous
versions of DN is eliminated now. This table is requested from operating
system and cannot be modified.

In lower part of the dialog there are three input lines: "Keyboard",
"WIN:" and "Additional codetables".

Line {Keyboard:_} defines the name of conversion file for symbols
entered in wrong keyboard layout and is used when pressing Alt-F12
in editor and input lines. This is usual conversion file (XLT)
which is located in XLT directory by default. Setting up a full path
to a file is allowed.
For Russian layout (441) such file is supplied with DN (ru441.xlt).
If you use other layout, for example, 443 ("typewriter"), then you can
easily build the corresponding conversion file.

Line {WIN:_} defines conversion from Windows code table
to DOS code table.
In DN for DOS in this line should be the name of .xlt file.
In versions for OS/2 and Windows there can be either the name
of .xlt file or the number of code page (1251 for Russian language).
In DN for Windows there is usually '0' here. In this case the code table
for conversion from ANSI to OEM will be used; this table is requested
from operating system.
It is strongly recommended to leave this setting as is, because this
table is used when working with filenames, therefore it is important
to make sure that this table corresponds to the operating system.

File win866r.xlt is supplied with DN, which defines reverse conversion
from CP 1251 to CP 866. This means that unconvertible symbols,
i.e. missing in target code page, are converted not to "?" as usual,
but to symbols which cannot be converted back. Besides such substitutions
are one-for-one, therefore conversion of any text is lossless.
Perhaps using this or similar table is the only case when setting
something different from zero in line WIN makes sense.

Line {Additional codetables:_} allows to define extra code tables,
one can switch between them by pressing F8 key in editor and viewer.
Example of setting up a code table:
KOI:koi8r.xlt. Here we define a code table which will appear in window
frame as "KOI" and assigned to conversion file koi8r.xlt
(conversion from KOI8-R to CP 866).
In versions for OS/2 and Windows one can define here a code page number
instead of conversion file name. In this line several code tables
can be listed using the space symbol as separator.

All modifications made in this dialog are applied after pressing
"{OK:_}" button if no errors will be revealed.
If "Cancel" button is pressed then the previous values for all parameters
will be used, even if "System" button was pressed before,
or if "OK" button was pressed but dialog was not closed due to revealed
errors.

directory Dir1, Dir2 as subdirectory of Dir2 etc.)

It is also possible to create several directories in different places of
your system. You should use semicolon to do that. For example, if you enter
'Dir1;Dir2;D:\Dir3', Navigator will create directories Dir1 and Dir2 in the
current directory and Dir3 - in the root directory of D: drive.

 ≥ Viewing and editing €
 ≥ files by extensions €
 ¿‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹€

When the user is in file panel, he may occasionally need to view/edit
a file by an external editor or a viewer. The possiblity to do it is
well-realized in Navigator.
For it, the files of extensions are used (for viewer - dn.vwr, for editor -
dn.edt).

This file describes work with particular file type, determined by extension.
To view/edit a file, you need to set the cursor on the file panel to the name
of the file, then for viewing press F3 and for editing press F4 (or Alt-F3
and Alt-F4 correspondingly, if Options|Defaults|{Configuration...:Configuration}
Internal editor is set to on).
If the above option is not set, to use the internal viewer/editor on such
file, press Alt-F3 or Alt-F4, correspondingly.
However, it is possible to specify an alternative viewer in the dnalt.vwr
file. Then the internal viewer can be called by Shift-Alt-F3 combination.

For the viewers description, call Options|Viewers.

For the editors description, call Options|Editors.

The format of a record in this file is such:

 ???:command_name

Here {???:_} is the extension
     {Command_name:_} is name of the program for viewing or editing

When viewing, it is possible to use filter programs - for example, to view
files which are by default not viewable with the internal viewer.
To perform it, !%F macro is used, that means the file into which the
filter program should write the file processing result.

Example:

doc:c:\programs\AntiWord\antiword.cmd !.! !%F

In this case, when trying to view a file with .doc extension, the antiword.cmd
file will be run, and it will have to read the file substituting "!.!"
(arranged by the Navigator), process it, and write into the file
substituting "!%F". After viewing, the !%F file will be deleted.


.topic Wildcards=48058
.title DOS Wildcards and Filters

DOS file names have two parts: the name (which  can be up to
8 characters) and  the  extension (which  can  be  up  to  3
characters)  with  a  period   in   between.  For   example,
"filename.ext".

   *   Match any characters for the  rest  of  the  name  or
       extension.  "a*" will  match "a", "ab", and "abc", as
       well as many others.  '*' applies just to one part of
       the  file  name, so "a*"  will not match "ab.c".  Use
       "a*.*" to find all files that start with 'a' and have
       any extension. (Note: "*a" will match  any  name, and
       not just names with an `a' at the end  as  you  might
       expect.)


DOS Navigator allows not only single file masks, but containers of
masks too. These containers are called {"Filters":_}.
Filter is a file mask sequence in that every mask is separated by ";" char.

E.g. :  *.exe;*.com;*.bat;*.btm;*.cmd
        *.asm;*.c;*.cpp;*.inc;*.pas      are Filters

.topic CustomVideo=48059
.title Customized Video modes

DOS Navigator supports not only standard text modes. It is possible to use
Super EGA, VGA and VESA BIOS extensions. If you want to use it,
put in System configuration dialog box "Video mode 1" and "Video mode 2" codes
of desired video modes. This codes must be described in technical documentation
of your Video system.

  Some of codes is known to me:
           29 (132x25),30 (132x60) - Realtek VGA cards
           84,85,86                - Trident VGA cards
           35 (132x25)             - ATI VGA cards
           80,81,82                - OAK Technology VGA cards
                         and most of Super EGA/VGA cards.

If your video system is VESA compatible, you can use universal VESA mode codes
(note that VESA XGA and VESA SVGA has different mode codes). These codes is
greater than 256. For VESA SVGA codes are 109 or 110, for example.

 {Note:_}: Most of mouse drivers doesn't support extended
        video modes. Therefore you must switch off
        "Standard cursor" option in {Mouse setup:MouseSetup} dialog box
        if you get any ugly effects when moving mouse cursor
        in non-standard video modes.

 {Hint:_}: For VGA adapters mode number 256 means mode 80x33.

.topic OS2Support=48060
.title OS/2 Support

NB: OS/2 is a registered trademark of IBM Corp.

DOS Navigator can start OS/2 applications when it works under OS/2 version
2.10 or later.

To get this possibility under OS/2 version 2.1x you should set OS2COMSPEC
environment variable to full name of OS/2 command interpreter
(e.g. put
    SET OS2COMSPEC = C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
 in DOS session autoexec.bat)
Under OS/2 Warp 3 or later it's only necessary if location of OS/2 command
interpreter is different than <bootdrive>:\os2\cmd.exe

 There are three ways to run OS/2 applications:

   ˛ From DOS command line:

     Put before command string one of chars listed below:
         ">" - run foreground Full Screen OS/2 session
         "<" - run background Full Screen OS/2 session
         "]" - run foreground Windowed OS/2 session
         "[" - run background Windowed OS/2 session
   ˛ Switch to OS/2 command prompt mode by {Alt-/:_}
   ˛ Run executable files from file panel:

     highlight required file and press
        - Alt-Shift-Enter to run it foreground
        - Alt-Ctrl-Enter to run background.

     NB: in OS/2 command prompt mode all programs
         include DOS applications  starts in another
         sessions. Be sure that parameters for DOS
         sessions are acceptable for your applications.

 {Hints:_}: ˛ if Files Highlight option is enabled
          OS/2 batch files (*.CMD) are shown as executable
          files. You can start it as usual .EXE files by
          pressing Enter. If you'll press Shift-Enter,
          batch will be started in background.

.topic FilesBBS=48061
.title 4DOS/Files.BBS support

 Yes, DOS Navigator supports it!

It is possible by setting up Panel|Setup Columns - just set
"Descriptions" checkbox on. Not only view descriptions is possible, but
copying, moving and editing too!

Copy/move file with its descriptions is possible only when descriptions are
present in file panel.

If you want to edit file description (by {Alt-INS:_} key), but file with
descriptions doesn't exists, Navigator will create file with first file name
given in "Files with descriptions" line of File Panel Defaults dialog box.

.title Navigator Link

Navigator Link allows to access remote computer by a common file {panel:LinkPanel}. The
following features are implemented: Create/Remove directories, Copy, View and
Erase files. Navigator Link uses its own communication protocol, developed by
RIT.

Advantages:

{- block streaming mode:_}

Navigator Link works seamlessly in {server/slave:LinkStatusWnd} mode and doesn't take full
CPU time during link session. It is also possible to work fine via packet
transport protocols (ipx/spx, tcp/ip) and other hardware (parrallel port) via
FOSSIL interface.

{- bi-directional mode and true full duplex:_}

Both machines linked by DN have equal rights on each other's drives, and both
can work with remote simultaneously.

{- advanced errror correction:_}

Navigator Link uses double-level selective reject method, so it works even on
high-noise lines.

{- real-time data compression:_}

Link allows to transfer text files and directory data twice faster on the
same line. The compression works more efficient than modems' internal
compression methods.

.title FTN File Attach Feature

DN has the ability to attach files to be sent with FTN networking software
using a Binkley-style outbound. To use this feature, the following information
should be appended to the Files with descriptions field in the File Manager
Setup dialog:

;/fido=<address>,<outbound>

Here <address> is your FTN address in your primary zone, written in 3D or 4D
form, and the <outbound> is your primary zone outbound directory specification.
Outbound directories for secondary zones are created and used with Portal Of
Power style names (with hexadecimal zone numbers as extensions). Outbound
subdirectories for points are handled correctly.

After that, for attaching select one or more files and press Alt-L for the Make
List File dialog. Enter either "%", "+", or "/" followed by the 3D or 4D
destination address instead of the list file name. "%" means Normal flavor, "+"
means Crash, and "/" is for Hold. Leave the Action field empty for the normal
send mode, enter ###:#\#.# there for the file to be tuncated after sending
(substitute ##!:!\!.! if your FTN software does not support long file names) or
enter ^#:#\#.# to have the file killed after sending (^!:!\!.! for short names
only).

.topic ZIPWithoutCentralDir=22000
.title ZIP archive without central directory

 All ZIP-archives must have special data block called central directory at
the end of archive file. It is impossible to extract any files from archive
without central directory. Current archive has no central directory (possibly,
because of uncompleted download of archive file). The viewing of current
archive contents is possible, but reparing of archive is necessary to extract
files. The original archive file will be kept unchanged, and new repared
file with new name will be created, usually "pkfixed.zip".
 No corrupted data will be recovered after such reparation, but all intact
data will be accessible for extracting.
 This operation is not integrated into DN/2 and must be performed manually.

 In case you are using {pkzip 2.5:_} for OS/2 or Win32, please enter such
command in command line:

pkzip /fix <archive name>

 or just try extract something from archive - archiver will prompt for
automatical archive reparing.

 In case you are using {pkzip / pkunzip:_} version 2.0x for OS/2 or version
up to 2.5 for DOS, please use PKZIPFIX utility to repare archive. Using of
earlier versions of PKZIPFIX for DOS in not recommended because it can cause
long names corruption.

 If you are using Infozip {unzip / zip:_}, please enter such
command in command line:

 zip -f <archive name>.
