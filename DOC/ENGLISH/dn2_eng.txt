
 Briefly about the project:

 DN/2 project - it is attempt to transfer DN OSP project on 32-bit platform
using Virtual Pascal compiler. The main goal of the project to create viable
native OS/2-version, and the development of WIN32 and DPMI32-version is
possible as secondary products.
 At the moment the project is in state of beta-testing and the product
proposed has quite a lot of bugs and limitations. Use it on your own risk.
The authors do not responsible for any possible disadvantage or damage,
caused by this product.

 Known bugs and limitations:

 - Some hotkeys are not working now, such as:
   - file panel modes switching with <Ctrl-1> - <Ctrl-0> in OS/2 version (you
     can however use menu called with <Alt-_> instead);
   - switching between windows with <Ctrl-Shift-1> - <Ctrl-Shift-0>;
   - incremental search of file in file panel could not be called with single
      Ctrl;
   - in Win9x <Shift-Tab> doesn't work in dialog windows. Use <Shift-Tab>,
     <Tab> instead;
   - in WinNT <Ctrl-Shift-Enter> doesn't work.
 - There is no and not planned in closest future built-in utilities, working
   through the direct access to disk;
