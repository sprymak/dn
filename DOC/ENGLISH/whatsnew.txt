[*] The ini-variable RecodeCyrillicNames is removed. Now DN always
    works as in case of RecodeCyrillicNames=0
[!] In VpSysLow unit the new define {$DEFINE B243} is introduced,
    allowing to compile DN/2 with the old VP 2.1 b243 build.

and fully reformatted for improve patches compatibility with DN/2 2.xx.
The subsequent patches are applicable to reformatted sources.
=======

sb40121.dif
[*] A current directory on a disk containing temporary directory was not
    restored after viewing any file from an archive on another disk.

sb40125b.dif
[-] With automatic refresh of file panels turned on, a quick search mask
    could appear on two panels simultaneously.

ak40125c.dif
[-] When the automatic refresh of file panels was turned on,
    a quick rename (Alt-F6) result had been displayed after some delay

ak40201c.dif (based on jo40103a.dif)

    of the cursor movement.
    Now this behaviour may be changed to the opposite by turning on the
    Scroll Lock keyboard mode. F.e. when Scroll Lock is turned On then
    the Up key produce text scrolling and the Ctrl-Up key produce
    the cursor movement.

    with error message

jo21230a
[*] In some units some references to unused units in "uses" statement had
    been removed
[*] In VpSysLo2 unit now variable RecodeAnsiNames will be used instead
    RecodeCyrillicNames, that makes this unit low-level as it was
    initially

[*] Now video mode will be set independently of presence saved desktop
[*] After switching videomodes the parts of file panels appeared on the
    output screen
[-] When DN/2 was started in console with nonstandard videomode the screen
    could be drawn in wrong way
[-] The videomode was restored after external programms launching despite
    "Restore screen mode" option switched off, that caused impossibility
    to use "mode" command for videomode changing
[-] In Win32 version the attempt to change videomode always caused
    changing the size of the console window, even if videomode changing
    failed
[*] In Win32 version the same videomode changing dialog will be proposed
    as in OS/2 version, but under Win9x only videomodes with line numbers
    25, 43 and 50 will be available
[-] In Win32 version in windowed session the lines number changing occured
    only to bigger values
[-] In Win32 version in windowed session the user screen was garbled after
    columns number changing
[*] In OS/2 version the artificial checking for "wrong" videomodes for
    fullscreen session is removed
[*] Now after failed attempt to change videomode the message that this
    videomode is impossible for current session will be shown

jo21218b
[-] After cat21104.dif patch the size of opened panels (file managers,
    editoes etc.) was not set in correspondence with current video mode.
    This could cause wrong winows size if the different videomode set for
    fullscreen and windowed sessions

jo21218c
[-] Under Win32 the left Alt key pressing followed by left Shift key
    pressing caused user screen to be closed with panels, and this was a
    reason of impossibility to use screen grabber
[-] Under Win32 Ctrl-] and Shift-Ctrl-] keys did not work if Russian
    keyboard layout was set in Windows as default
[-] Under OS/2 Ctrl-], Ctrl-[, Shift-Ctrl-] and Shift-Ctrl-[ if some

[-] File Find in Arvid drive didn't work
[*] When copying from archive files are extracted first to the temporary
    directory created in destination directory and next files are moved to
    the destination directory and temporary directory is removed. This
    method improve user interface: standard overwrite dialog used and
    directories tree is recreated from current point and not from the
    arcive root. For floppyes (i.e. A: and B:) old method used.

ak21213a ak21207b ak21208a

ak21014b [-] DN crash if in panel settings is unchecked 'Current file' and
             is checked 'Long name in bottom'
ak21015a [*] Теперь операция 'Ассоциировать список файлов' распознает имена
             файлов  в списке по такому алгоритму:
             - если первый символ строки пробел или '>' - строку ингорировать
               (это на случай использования многострочных описаний в качестве
               списка);
             - если первый символ кавычка ('"') - считать именем текст до
               следующей кавычки;
             - если первый символ не из вышеперечисленных - сначала
               попробовать в качестве имени взять всю строку;
             - если такого файла не нашлось, но в строке есть пробелы -
               считать именем текст до первого пробела.
ak21022a [-] При выходе из архива, вложенного в другой архив, курсор
             перескакивал на элемент "..".
ak21022b [*] Теперь позиция окна формирования фильтра по расширениям (Alt-BS)

             каталоге.
         [*] Оптимизирована программа D&D из строки информации о каталоге.
         [-] Устранены ошибки начала drag&drop из подвала панели
ak21109a [-] Теперь в Win32 версии под WinNT для каталогов работает установка
             времени создания, последнего доступа и последней модификации
ak211110 [*] Теперь для операции 'Присоединить список' добавился еще один
             вариант распознавания имени файла: вся строка без первого
             символа (для BSO).
ak21118a [-] При включенном автодочитывании если после коррекции файла в
             hex-режиме переключиться в текстовый режим, выводилось
             предупреждение о том, что файл изменен и DN падал. Теперь
             модификация файла прекращает его автодочитывание
ak21118b [*] Теперь при монтировании списка символ Tab (#09) воспринимается
             как признак начала комментария
ak21119a [-] Теперь копирование файла в себя же, но с точками (типа f в f..)
             приводит к правильному сообщению, а не к предложению перезаписать
             файл
ak21119b [-] Теперь нажатие мыши на линии разделителя пассивной панели
             активного менеджера приводит к активизации панели и скроллингу,
             аналогично нажатию мыши на заголовке панели.


         Aleksej Kozlov:

plugins4 [!] Плагины версии 0.4
cat21104 [!] Поддержка плагинов типа DrivePanel
cat21013 [*] Функции GetAltChar и GetCtrlChar теперь реагируют только на
             нажатия соответственно Alt-символ и Ctrl-символ, и не реагируют
             на сложные комбинации (Ctrl-Shift-символ, Alt-Shift-символ,
             Ctrl-Alt-символ)
         [*] Чуть более корректная обработка клавиатурных событий
cat21015 [*] Win32-версия теперь умеет распознавать нажатия левой и правой
             виндозных клавиш, клавиши "меню" и их комбинаций с Shift, Ctrl, Alt
cat21025 [*] TaskList: добавлена горизонтальная полоса прокрутки
         [*] TaskList: раньше заголовки окон показывались в списке
             как попало, теперь их левые края выравниваются
         [*] TaskList: небольшая логическая реорганизация исходников
cat21030 [*] TaskList: теперь если в INI-файле стоит KillAllowed=0, то кнопка
             "Убить" не только ничего не делает, но и не появляется вовсе
cat21104 [*] В связи с появлением плагина панели Network из ядра выкинуты
             остатки от аналогичного кода (т.е. то, что включалось дефайном
             Network)
         [*] Плагины типа EventCatcher теперь грузятся по следующему принципу:
             для плагина PLUGIN сначала ДН пытается загрузить PLUGIN.DLL, а
             если это не удаётся, то грузит PLUGIN\PLUGIN.DLL. То есть, теперь
             можно все файлы плагина скидывать в один каталог
         [-] Исправлены ошибки в функции SysUtils.Format. Это могло
             проявляться при падениях в виде мусора вместо нормальных
             сообщений об ошибках
         [*] Функция Drivers.FormatStr теперь понимает описатель формата "%p"
             - указатель - выводится как шестнадцатеричное число из 8 цифр.
             Это сделано для использования в функции SysUtils.Format, т.к.
             некоторые сообщения об ошибках содержат такой описатель формата.
             Кроме того, функция Format теперь вынесена в интерфейсную часть
             SysUtils - вдруг пригодится. Также в модуле SysUtils отключены
             длинные строки
         [*] Теперь в случае каких-либо проблем с DSK-файлом ДН не падает,
             как раньше, а выводит сообщение об ошибке и продолжает работу.
             Надеюсь, надобность в ручном удалении DN.DSK при переходе на
             новую версию тоже отпадёт
         [*] Раньше в случае Fatal Error-ов и прочих ошибок, приводящих к
             выходу из ДН-а, в Win32-версии текст сообщения об ошибке мог
             показываться начиная не с левого верхнего угла, а откуда-то с
             середины экрана
cat21109a [*] Небольшие правки кода, связанного с плагинами
cat21109b [-] Для представления дисков в диалогах "открыть файл",
             "сохранить как", и пр. используются псевдо-каталоги вида "[-C-]".
             Раньше это приводило к следующей проблеме: если в каком-либо
             каталоге создать подкаталог, начинающийся с "[", то когда мы
             попытаемся в него войти в диалоге, ДН посчитает, что надо
             перейти на какой-то диск, что и попытается сделать вместо входа
             в подкаталог
cat21117  [*] Восстановлена компилируемость модуля PktView


         Jaroslaw Osadtchiy:

             under w9x is fixed
jo21022b [-] Cursor in editor did not stop at the end of line when the
             Ctrl-Right hotkey was used to move cursor
jo21023a [-] The attempt to go to some addres by F5 in file viewer in
             disassembler mode caused DN/2 halt
         [-] The hexadecimal editing in file viewer in disassembler mode
             caused changing wrong bytes, not positioned under cursor
jo21030c,
jo21101a,
jo21103a [*] In directories compare dialog the comparing parameters saving is
             possible now by pressing "Save" button
jo21104a [-] The highliting of size, date, time and description of selected
             files disappeared after switching to opposite panel
         [-] In 252.0 columns mode the fields situated before file name
             field were not highlited for selected files
         [*] Now size and description fields, as well as compression ratio
             in archives, are highlited completely, not only text; the path
             field in file find panel now also highlited
jo21104b [-] When file cursor was moved to opposite panel by Tab key, the
             separators between fields with information about current file had
             color of file name
jo21105a [-] The .tdr-files viewing was broken; fixed

             panel sometimes wrong error messages appeared
jo21107a [-] Directory changing (Alt-T) from archive panel did not work
             correctly
jo21107b [-] Menu items "Panel" => "Re-read", "Window" => "Next similar",
             "Prev similar", "Next different", "Prev different" did not
             become disabled when the actions corresponding them were
             impossible
jo21107c [-] Shift-Grey+ and Shift-Grey- hotkeys work again for switching
             between several file manager windows
jo21108a [*] In task list in OS/2 version the filtered list mode added, and
             dn.ini key FilteredList (Boolean) added to switch this mode.
             When filtered list mode the processes appear in task list only
             if it is possible to switch to teses processes (to make them
             active)
         [*] The dn.ini key UserTaskFilter (String) added, which allows to
             set executable names of those processes, which must be excluded
             from task list. The names should be separated with symbol "#",

             history some bugs occured in remaining panel (wrong panel header,
             impossibility to enter subdirectory in archive)
         [-] After entering archive from directories history the header of
             archive panel could be wrong and after exiting such archive the
             cursor was positioned to top of panel, but not to archive

Aleksej Kozlov:

[!] All keycodes are redesigned based on the unified scheme:
        kbNNNN = $XXYYZZ
        XX - shift flags: 3 - Shift, 4 - Ctrl, 8 - Alt
        YY - scan-code of the key
        ZZ - symbol keycode

Jaroslaw Osadtchiy:

[!] File search inside archives is added; it is possible to go to files found
    with Enter or with Ctrl-PgDg and to view files found with F3; when go to
    files found with Enter, after leaving archive we go to directory
    containing archive, whereas when go to files found with Ctrl-PgDn, after
    leaving archive we go back to search panel
[-] After videomode change in OS/2 version the console cursor vas positioned
    to upper left corner befor executing any external program
[*] In OS/2 version the "@echo off" string will not be added to temporary
    batch (.cmd) files, if the first string of these files begins from "\*"
    or "#!" (sign of REXX and Perl scripts)
[*] Now when attempt to enter RAR-archive with encrypted headers was done the
    explaining message will bw shown
[*] Now in the dialog of file selection/deselection (Grey+ and Grey-) the mask
    ended by "\" will select directories instead files (for example mask

[*] The new dn.ini key BlinkSeparator added to section [Clock] to switch
    on/off the separator blinking in clock with seconds switched off
[*] Now in OS/2 version the string "@echo off" will not be added to temporary
    CMD-file, created to execute user menu command if the first line of this
    command begins with "/*" (the REXX-script sign) or "#!" (the Perl-script
    sign)
[*] The reading of directory is optimized for Win32 versions, compiled with
    define {$DEFINE RecodeWhenDraw}
[*] The file search in directory procedures are simplified
[*] The size of the help window now depends from videomode
[*] The speed of entering directories increased noticeable (up to 2 times)

    Boolean; with values 2 or more DN/2 works with file names in ANSI code
    table without any recoding
[*] Now DN/2 does not warn about ZIP-archives without central directory during
    search files inside archives
[*] The error messages dialog now have default red color like in classical DN
    and DN OSP; In the "Colors" dialog the "Help" and "Error messages dialog"
    color group added, the item "Cluster disabled" added to color group
    "Dialog"
[-] While attempting to detect some NE-executables as SFX-archives DN/2 had
    gone to endless cycle
[-] in Win32 version the removable disk devices could be shown as hard drives
[-] Sometimes DN/2 halted during help windov viewing
[*] Now if in dn.ini ReuseEditors=0 and ReuseViewers=0 had been set, then the
    order of already opened windows will not be changed before the opening of
    second viewer or editor window with file, which had already been opened in
    editor or viewer window
[*] The option "Force mode" added to "Extract files" dialog appearing when
    unpacking files from archive
[*] The saving of some settings to dn.ini optimized
[-] While archiving files by Shift-F1, if in passive panel the subdirectory
    inside archive was shown, and in archiver settings the "Set path inside"
    option was set, then the archive was created with subdirectory with path
    the same is in archive shown in passive panel, and files were placed in
    this directory
[-] Under systems without Video Device Handler (bvhvga.dll or analogous), i.e.
    when OS/2 booted from diskette, the OS/2 version of DN/2 halted on attempt
    to set videomode different from 80x25
[*] Now the unpacker will have long or short archive name as command line
    parameter depending of "Use long file names" option in archiver settings
[*] Now in RAR archiver settings in "Unpacker" input line it is possible to
    set two unpackers, separated by ";" symbol; in this case the first
    unpacker will be used for unpacking archives with version 2.0 and lower,
    the second one - for archives with version 2.90 and higher
[*] Now in information panel (called by Ctrl-L) in information about archive
    the version of archiver necessary to extract from archive is shown not
    only for RAR, but also for ACE
[*] If current panel contains RAR-archive contents, then in information panel
    (called by Ctrl-L) in information about archive the version of archiver
    necessary to extract from archive is shown


Max Vasilyev:

[*] Some default settings changed to be more close to DN OSP,
    also some columns settings changed to eliminate discrepancy between OS/2
    and Win32 versions
[+] the lists of highlited file groups expanded up to DN OSP state
[*] Bugfixed .ZIP's central directory detection and reading
[+] partial .ZIP span disks support added
[*] DN willn't hang on RAR 3.0 archives with encrypted headers anymore
