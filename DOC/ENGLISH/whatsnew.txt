    drives which don't support EA DN/2 crashed
[*] Some EA-copying error messages will not appear any more during files
    copying from drives, which don't support EA and during EA-posessing files

    the message appeared about device error anf file was not copied
[-] The message about error in file vieved will be more adequate
[-] Now on file panel mouse scrolling (except selection) cursor not
    move file-by-file, but jump to first file not shown
[-] Under OS/2 wrong quotes generation and trailing spaces removing
    by '!', '.!', '$', '.$' macros is removed. Now these macros are
    equvivalent to '#', '.#', '&', '.&'
[*] Some small optimizations
[-] File viewer did not check any file errors
[+] Now in Quick View panel is shown some information about directory: number
    of subdirectories, number of files and total size of files
[-] Function IsDir return 'false' for hidden directories


Aleksej Kozlov:

[!] All keycodes are redesigned based on the unified scheme:
        kbNNNN = $XXYYZZ
        XX - shift flags: 3 - Shift, 4 - Ctrl, 8 - Alt
        YY - scan-code of the key
        ZZ - symbol keycode
[*] In OS/2-version the Alt-tilde will work properly
[*] In OS/2-version the Ctrl-[, Ctrl-] combinations become working with Russian
    keyboard layout
[*] In Win32-version no status line blinking occure any more after pressing of
    key combimations with Shift or Alt


Jaroslaw Osadtchiy:

[!] File search inside archives is added; it is possible to go to files found
    with Enter or with Ctrl-PgDg and to view files found with F3; when go to
    files found with Enter, after leaving archive we go to directory
    containing archive, whereas when go to files found with Ctrl-PgDn, after
    leaving archive we go back to search panel
[-] After videomode change in OS/2 version the console cursor vas positioned
    to upper left corner befor executing any external program
[*] In OS/2 version the "@echo off" string will not be added to temporary
    batch (.cmd) files, if the first string of these files begins from "\*"
    or "#!" (sign of REXX and Perl scripts)
[*] Now when attempt to enter RAR-archive with encrypted headers was done the
    explaining message will bw shown
[*] Now in the dialog of file selection/deselection (Grey+ and Grey-) the mask
    ended by "\" will select directories instead files (for example mask
    "*.os2;*.os2\" will select files and directories with extension ".os2"
[*] The new dn.ini key BlinkSeparator added to section [Clock] to switch
    on/off the separator blinking in clock with seconds switched off
[*] Now in OS/2 version the string "@echo off" will not be added to temporary
    CMD-file, created to execute user menu command if the first line of this
    command begins with "/*" (the REXX-script sign) or "#!" (the Perl-script
    sign)
[*] The reading of directory is optimized for Win32 versions, compiled with
    define {$DEFINE RecodeWhenDraw}
[*] The file search in directory procedures are simplified
[*] The size of the help window now depends from videomode
[*] The speed of entering directories increased noticeable (up to 2 times)
[*] The dn.ini file variable RecodeCyrillicNames now has type Byte instead
    Boolean; with values 2 or more DN/2 works with file names in ANSI code
    table without any recoding
[*] Now DN/2 does not warn about ZIP-archives without central directory during
    search files inside archives
[*] The error messages dialog now have default red color like in classical DN
    and DN OSP; In the "Colors" dialog the "Help" and "Error messages dialog"
    color group added, the item "Cluster disabled" added to color group
    "Dialog"
[-] While attempting to detect some NE-executables as SFX-archives DN/2 had
    gone to endless cycle
[-] in Win32 version the removable disk devices could be shown as hard drives
[-] Sometimes DN/2 halted during help windov viewing
[*] Now if in dn.ini ReuseEditors=0 and ReuseViewers=0 had been set, then the
    order of already opened windows will not be changed before the opening of
    second viewer or editor window with file, which had already been opened in
    editor or viewer window
[*] The option "Force mode" added to "Extract files" dialog appearing when
    unpacking files from archive
[*] The saving of some settings to dn.ini optimized
[-] While archiving files by Shift-F1, if in passive panel the subdirectory
    inside archive was shown, and in archiver settings the "Set path inside"
    option was set, then the archive was created with subdirectory with path
    the same is in archive shown in passive panel, and files were placed in
    this directory
[-] Under systems without Video Device Handler (bvhvga.dll or analogous), i.e.
    when OS/2 booted from diskette, the OS/2 version of DN/2 halted on attempt
    to set videomode different from 80x25
[*] Now the unpacker will have long or short archive name as command line
    parameter depending of "Use long file names" option in archiver settings
[*] Now in RAR archiver settings in "Unpacker" input line it is possible to
    set two unpackers, separated by ";" symbol; in this case the first
    unpacker will be used for unpacking archives with version 2.0 and lower,
    the second one - for archives with version 2.90 and higher
[*] Now in information panel (called by Ctrl-L) in information about archive
    the version of archiver necessary to extract from archive is shown not
    only for RAR, but also for ACE
[*] If current panel contains RAR-archive contents, then in information panel
    (called by Ctrl-L) in information about archive the version of archiver
    necessary to extract from archive is shown


Max Vasilyev:

[*] Some default settings changed to be more close to DN OSP,
    also some columns settings changed to eliminate discrepancy between OS/2
    and Win32 versions
[+] the lists of highlited file groups expanded up to DN OSP state
[*] Bugfixed .ZIP's central directory detection and reading
[+] partial .ZIP span disks support added
[*] DN willn't hang on RAR 3.0 archives with encrypted headers anymore
