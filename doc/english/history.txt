   Version 1.51.12
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> Compatibility issues <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] 3.5" 2.88 megabyte floppy drives are now correctly identified in the
    System Information and Format windows (Ondrej Zary)

[-] Some drive types were reported incorrectly by the DPMI version under pure
    DOS (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Selecting Abort in the System Error window caused a crash in DPMI version
    under pure DOS (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Long file names could not be used on Novell NetWare remote drives
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Clear Read-Only from CD-ROM option did not work in DPMI version under pure
    DOS (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The CopyLimit parameter from [Kernel] section of DN.INI was used not only
    in Windows, but in DOS too. This did not match the documented behavior
    (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The SmartWindowsBoxClose DN.INI parameter ([Kernel] section) almost never
    worked. Now it is fixed both for real-mode and DPMI versions. The only
    limitation remaining is that you should start DN.COM from Windows
    directly, not, for example, from a batch file, in order for the close
    button to work (Vitaly Astaforkin)

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] New DN.INI parameter: UseF3InViewer = long ([Interface] section). Similar
    to the existing UseEnterInViewer parameter ([Interface] section). When set
    to 0, pressing F3 in viewer does nothing; when set to 1, F3 closes the
    viewer window; and the value of 2 means that F3 should cycle through
    text, hexadecimal and dump view modes (Alexey Feldgendler)

[+] New DN.INI parameter: PoorFrames = bool ([Interface] section). Value of 1
    means that the character encoding being used does not contain all the
    pseudographic characters. In this case DN uses a reduced set of characters
    for rendering various boxes (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] Made the memory allocation for DN.INI parameters more efficient
    (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] When reading DN.INI file, syntax errors are reported along with the
    corresponding line numbers (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] Optimized writing of DN.INI (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] The colour of scrollbars in the database viewer is now customizeable
    (Max Morozov)

[*] Updated some default values: enabled Advanced copy, turned on Check free
    space for all drives, added some new column presets (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The Ending string in the Printer setup was ignored (Anton Fedorov)

    >>> File manager <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] When HandleChDirCommand=1 is set in the [Kernel] section of DN.INI, one
    can browse remote drives without mapping them to drive letters. To change
    to a shared network resource, just enter "cd \\server_name\resource_name"
    (Anton Fedorov)

[*] Directories are now compared using long file names (Max Morozov)

[*] When copying files, the system cache is flushed each time after writing
    the whole RAM load, in case when more than one megabyte was transferred.
    The tests show that it really speeds up copying (Stanislav Olkhovik)

[*] Disabled syntax highlighting for Quick View panels, as handling it
    properly would require introducing too many color customzation entries
    (Max Morozov)

[-] File search could find particular files not matching the wildcard pattern
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Renaming a file with Alt-F6 to one of the description file names like
    files.bbs caused its content to be damaged (Anton Fedorov)

[-] After renaming a file, a stray space appeared between its name and
    description in the descriptions file (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The last description from a descriptions file could be deleted incorrectly
    (Max Vasilyev)

[-] File sizes were not shown according to the country setup
    (Marcin Gryszkalis)

[-] Fixed display of sizes for very large files, including compressed sizes
    in archives (Marcin Gryszkalis, Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Files viewed with external facilities are now correctly recorded into the
    view history unless they reside in a temporary storage like files
    extracted from archives for viewing (Alexey Feldgendler)

[*] Optimized the Open file at cursor Editor feature by speed, not changing
    the logic (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Improved the Open file at cursor Editor feature: fixed the logic for
    extracting the file name from the current line, added correct handling
    of absolute pathnames, made cosmetic changes to the related user
    interface. Also fixed the newly created DN.SPF not becoming visible until
    refresh (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Fixed a possible crash when opening an Editor window (Anton Fedorov)

[-] When opening a file in Editor, stray empty lines could appear
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] After viewing a file with an internal viewer (Alt-F3) it was impossible to
    view it with an external tool (F3) because it was recorded in the view
    history. Now F3 always selects the viewer that matches the file's
    extension, be that viewer internal or external. Selecting an entry from
    the view history still activates the viewer last used for the file
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> User Add-on Package <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added more examples and fixed some old ones in the DN.EXT, DN.HGL, DN.XRN
    configuration files from the User Add-on Package (Andrzej Kowalczyk)

    >>> Archivers <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] Fixed reading of WinRAR 2.80 beta 1 and later archives (Max Vasilyev)

    >>> System Information <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added Windows ME (Millenium Edition) detection (Ondrej Zary)

[*] OS/2 Warp Server for e-Business version is shown in System Information
    (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Too many LPT ports was sometimes reported by the System Information
    (Anton Fedorov)

    >>> Miscellanous <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] DDI disk images can be unpacked (Max Vasilyev)

[*] Added arcctg function to Calculator as a synonym to arccotan
    (Michael Mercuryev)

[-] Fixed sqrt function in Calculator (Michael Mercuryev)

[-] Fixed the VGA palette not being properly initialized on startup
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] After running an external program, the VGA palette was reset to the
    default values (Marcin Gryszkalis)

[-] When in 132-conumn extended video mode, the initial state of the video
    mode selection menu did not reflect the current mode (Pawel Ziemian)

[-] Pressing PgUp while moving a window would cause it to jump off the screen
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] A help window called from a menu could be obscured by it
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Characters with decimal code 255 used in the Help window could cause
    unwanted visual effects sometimes and were replaced with spaces
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[-] Multiple cosmetic fixes to the Russian user interface (Michael Mercuryev)

[-] Fixed a number of other bugs, minor and not...


   Version 1.51.11
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> Compatibility issues <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] DN caused a conflict with LFN00X long file name services for Windows NT
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] DN caused a conflict with QEMM memory manager (Jiri Travnicek)

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] New DN.INI parameter: RecombineLongLines = bool ([Editor] section). As
    before, lines longer than 255 characters are cut into several lines when
    loading a file in any case. But now, when the new option is enabled, each
    line that is exactly 255 or 254 characters long is recombined with the
    next line when saving the file or writing the selected block to a file.
    This allows limited editing of files with lines longer than 255
    characters: all usual editing can be done on the last line segment, and
    only character replacement, but not insertion or deletion, is possible on
    the prior segments (in order not to change their length). To indicate the
    special status of these lines, they are highlit when hit by the cursor
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[*] Added 1ST, ANI, BAS, CC, CHR, CUR, CXX, DB, DIB, HPP, HXX, JAV, JAVA, JS,
    MAK, ME, MOV and WP extensions to the corresponding highlight group
    defaults (Alexey Feldgendler)

[*] Tweaked the default palette setting for the Terminal window frame
    (Alexey Nemytov)

[-] Some accented Cyryllic characters used in Russia and Ukraine were not
    subject to case conversion by default (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] A value of zero accidentally specified for the screensaver delay could
    make DN lock up in an endless loop (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> File manager <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] On 104-key extended keyboards, the Menu key now opens the menu associated
    with the extension of the current file. This allows to free Alt-Enter for
    Windows needs (Michael Averbukh)

[-] Drive type captions in the drive selection menu were always in English
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added support for text files with LFCR-style line breaks (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed detection of line break type (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> User Add-on Package <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added many new xlat tables to the User Add-on Package
    (Pavel Protasov, Andrzej Kowalczyk)

[*] Added more examples and fixed some old ones in the DN.EXT, DN.HGL, DN.MNU,
    DN.SPF configuration files from the User Add-on Package
    (Andrzej Kowalczyk, Alexey Feldgendler)

[*] The User Add-on Package now contains DN.INI with English and Russian
    comments describing each parameter (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> Miscellanous <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Splitting the DNUtil unit into two parts and placing the one that is not
    required to be constantly present into the overlay helped to free up some
    conventional memory without suffering in performance (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Cosmetic fixes of many dialog windows in Russian resources (Pavel Borodin)

[-] Fixed a number of other bugs, minor and not...


   Version 1.51.10

    >>> Compatibility issues <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] DN was unable to utilize the long file name services under Windows NT and
    dosemu (Anton Fedorov)

[-] DN was extremely unstable under Windows NT. In particular, it was unable

    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] DN did not work in real mode under MS-DOS (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Access to Novell Netware shared volumes was impossible or erratic

[*] Reverted to quick sort in real mode. This increased both performance and
    reliability of the real mode version (Anton Fedorov)

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] New DN.INI parameter: UseEnterInViewer = long ([Interface] section). When
    set to 0, pressing Enter in viewer does nothing; when set to 1, Enter
    closes the viewer window; and the value of 2 means that Enter should
    cycle through text, hexadecimal and dump view modes (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[*] The information set shown in the drive selection menu is now configurable
    not only by modifying the DriveInfoType DN.INI parameter directly, but

[-] After cancelling the Branch panel building, it is now shown empty without
    any weird effects (Anton Fedorov)

[*] Description files with descriptions linked to long file names are now
    correctly read and updated. However, new descriptions are still linked to
    short names (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed updation of the description file with file operations: now the
    descriptions are correctly updated and deleted when copying, moving and
    deleting files even if there are several descriptions for a particular
    file (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[-] After automatically updating the description file like descript.ion,
    its attributes were reset (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed deletion of descriptions spanning several lines (Max Vasilyev)

    1 means to store them as video mode 1, and 2 means to store them as video
    mode 2 (Pawel Ziemian)

[+] New DN.INI parameter: DoVESATest = bool ([Kernel] section). When on, VESA
    132 characters wide modes are available, but Windows can do annoying
    switches to full-screen mode (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] DN specific video modes are now encoded with numbers that do not conflict
    with VESA mode numbers. The current assignment requires to add up the two
    numbers, the first being 128 for the horizontal dimension of 40
    characters, 144 for 80 and 160 for 94, and the second being 0 for the

    method (Anton Fedorov)

[*] Changed column defaults for modes 3 and 4 (Max Vasilyev)

[*] Returned the Combined case its original meaning (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Ctrl-Shift-Arrows had unexpected effect on the command line
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Sometimes the command line could enter the OS/2 session spawn mode under
    operating systems other than OS/2 (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Ctrl-Arrows with only one panel visible now always change the drive it

    (GENERALFLAGS keyword) that allows to recognize floats with missing
    integer part and a new string flag (STRINGFLAGS keyword) (value 128) that
    restricts control character sequences highlighting to caret-letter pairs

[*] Tweaked window sizing logic. Alt-Z now toggles between the maximum (with
    fully visible borders) and the prior size, and Ctrl-Alt-Z switches the
    extra-large (with invisible side borders) and the prior size. This is
    true for the editor, viewer and terminal windows. The file manager window
    was also subject to modification: Ctrl-Alt-Z now only enlarges the current
    panel to the size of the whole file manager window, not zooming the latter
    to the screen extent and leaving this task up to Alt-Z. This influenced a
    change of DN.DSK desktop file format (Anton Fedorov)

[!] Totally replaced the INI engine. In particular, all the user comments are
    left intact when automatically updating (Anton Fedorov)

[+] New DN.INI parameter: SmartWindowsBoxClose = bool ([Kernel] section).
    When enabled, an attempt to close Windows 9x/2000 console box is
    equivalent to pressing Alt-X in DN (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[+] New DN.INI parameter: StoreVideoMode2 = bool ([Kernel] section). A value
    of 1 states that a video mode selected via Shift-F12 is to be saved as
    the second video mode (Anton Fedorov)

    When enabled, the copy progress indicator grows from right to left when
    copying files from right panel to left (Anton Fedorov)

[+] New DN.INI parameters: ReuseViewers = long, ReuseEditors = long
    ([Interface] section). The first parameter affects viewer windows, the
    second one affects editor windows. When set to 1, instead of opening a new
    separate window for a file already opened, a prompt to activate the
    existing window is issued. When set to 2, the existing windows are
    activated without prompts. Zero means to always open a new window
    (Anton Novosyolov, Anton Fedorov)

[+] Instead of simply warning the user that the FTN information is to be set,
    a corresponding dialog window is now shown (Anton Fedorov)

    initialized depending on what drive is active on the non-active panel on
    dialog opening and have priority over the system setup settings
    (Anton Fedorov)

[+] Added the option to always copy the file descriptions (File Manager
    setup). When enabled, the Copy descriptions check box in the copy dialog
    will be checked by default. In this mode all the description contaners
    (descript.ion, files.bbs, etc) are excluded from group mark and invert
    operations (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[+] Added the option for alternative Ctrl distinguishing logic. When on, right
    Ctrl relates to the active panel and left Ctrl relates to the passive
    panel. When off, each Ctrl relates to that panel on what side of keyboard
    it is (Anton Fedorov)

[+] Added 5 more highlight groups to the 5 existing (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[+] Country Setup now has the ability to import the parameters from DOS locale

    and html (Anton Fedorov)

[+] Everywhere in a file pattern specification the * and ? characters can be
    used multiple times, plus any of the following constructions:
        [abc0-9_] - matches exactly one character from abc0123456789_
        [^ax-z] - matches exactly one character NOT from axyz
        "characters" - matches the characters literally
    (Anton Fedorov)

    horizontal scrolling (Anton Fedorov)

[-] DN could hang up when moving the panel delimiter with Alt-Right/Left
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[+] The two new file sorting modes are designed to order files by their long
    names and by long extensions (Anton Fedorov)

[*] The new algorithm used for sorting significantly decreases the time it
    takes to enter a directory with large number of files (Anton Fedorov)

[*] Panels are not reread after changing sorting options (Anton Fedorov)

[*] A rotating dash is shown in the upper-left corner of the screen while
    reading directories (Anton Fedorov)

[*] The current file remains current after changing sorting options
    (Anton Fedorov)

[*] A single click on a drive letter in the Drive Bar is equivalent to Ctrl-R.
    A double click brings to the root directory of a drive (Anton Fedorov)

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[!] The editor is now able to open files of unlimited size. Yet implemented
    only in DPMI version (Anton Fedorov)

[+] As an experimental feature, disassembly mode has been added to the viewer,
    activated with F4 as the fourth mode (Anton Fedorov)

    !%F macro is not an external viewer, but an external filter specification,
    where !%F is expanded to a fully qualified short name for the temporary
    file to be created by the filter program. After filtering, internal viewer
    opens with that temporary file's contents. When the user attempts to
    modify such file either with the viewer or by starting editor with Alt-E,
    he or she is warned that it will be impossible to save the modified file
    back through the filter. If the user agrees, a consequential attempt to
    save the file produces the Save As dialog (Anton Fedorov)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> Long File Names <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

     3: 1 and 2 together

[+] The "cd path" and D: commands are now handled by DN itself, without
    starting a command shell. This can be disabled by setting the
    HandleChDirCommand = bool DN.INI parameter ([Kernel] section) to zero

[+] Added auto detecting of codepage for a file newly opened for editing (not
    present in the editing history). For auto detecting, set the
    DefCodePage = str DN.INI parameter ([Editor] section) to AUTO. For WIN or

    with a dot

[*] The extension specifications in the editor, viewer, etc configuration
    files can now contain ? and *.

[-] An attempt to activate a panel for a CD-ROM directory when the CD-ROM was

    the current record in this mode; move the cursor or click the mouse to
    cancel quick search first

[*] When a long file name entered in the search window does not contain .,
    * and ? characters, each space in the name is replaced by a * and an extra

[*] The Current archiver command brought to the top of Archivers menu

[*] A submenu that does not fit the screen, for instance the Archivers menu,
    is now scrolled

[*] The first submenu of the main menu (the System Menu) is now shown as the
    "." (#4) because of the previously used character (#240) sometimes
    appearing as a cyryllic letter. There is an option to specify any other
    character instead

[-] "UU-encode" and "Directory tree" commands in the Russian resources were
    both bound to Ctrl-F7 hot key

[-] The drive selection menu from Ctrl-F3 and in some other cases was shown
    with a very strange shadow

[-] The current directory name containing a tilde character was shown
    incorrectly in the drive selection menu as well as long file names with
    tilde characters were displayed in weird colours

[*] Brought back the colour customization options for the Trash can

[*] Cosmetic fixes to the Russian resources (some strings were in English,
    one message was broken, highlighted letters caused a conflict in the
    editor menu, the menu items order was different from the English
    resources, highlighted letters caused a conflict in the Archive dialog) as
    well as the English resources (highlighted letters caused a conflict in
    the Archive dialog)

[+] The prompt to copy next file when there is insufficient space for the
    current one now has an All button, which causes Yes to be implied for all
    such prompts for the duration of the current copy operation

[*] When Check free space option is on, the destination drive is checked to
    have enough free space to accomodate all the files, and if it has not,
    a prompt to attempt the copy operation is displayed

[-] Deleting a file's description from descript.ion, files.bbs sometimes left
    a blank line in the description file

[-] The Horizontal scroll bar in the editor window was sometimes shown
    incorrectly

[-] When the editor window became inactive and its border turned single-lined,
    the left border remained double-lined

[+] Replace All operation in the editor is now undone and redone as a single
    action

[-] Ctrl-J in the editor with Russian resources opened the Terminal window
    instead of executing macros

[+] A new hotkey Alt-" (Alt-quote) quickly toggles the hidden files display
    mode

[-] Some keys pressed with Shift while quick searching could cause DN to
    change to the upper directory

[+] Alt-Z zooms the current panel to the full screen or restores its prior
    state

[-] Fixed a bug related to Alt-Z handling in the viewer

[+] The editor window can now be horizontally zoomed just like the viewer by
    pressing Alt-Z

[-] F3 opened all files as plain text, ignoring DBF and WKZ extensions

[-] The Word wrap options worked only when the Line wrap was on

[-] In the hex viewer for short files it was possible to use Ctrl-PgDown only
    after a Ctrl-PgUp

[+] When reading new or updated DN.INI, the parameters are saved in the binary
    form to dn.cfg. If DN.INI was not touched since the last start, it shall
    not be read over again

[*] All DN.INI parameters related to the Clock were moved to the new [Clock]
    section

[*] The SmallClock parameter was renamed to ShowSeconds and its meaning was
    inverted

[*] There is a space and not comma between the day-of-week name and the date
    shown by the clock while Ctrl is held

[+] When ShowSeconds = 0, the colon between hours and minutes flashes every
    second

[*] Fixed clock positioning logic. When they are in the right half of the
    screen, they are right-aligned to a fixed horizontal position,
    and when they are in the left half, they are left-aligned. Also fixed the
    intermediate state between ShowSeconds = 0 and ShowSeconds = 1

[*] File attributes window now shows four digits for the creation date

[+] The new Change language command in the System menu (Alt-F12 hot key)
    changes the current interface language 'on the fly'. It causes the
    ActiveLanguage DN.INI parameter to change its value and DN automatically
    restarts (the user is prompted to save all the files being edited). Some
    windows still fail to change its language automatically (Editor, CD
    Player, some other) and they are to be closed and opened again

[*] The resource files for each language have the new names <language>.lng and
    <language>.dlg, and the help file names are <language>.hlp. There is no
    need to rename these files anymore. It is strongly recommended to delete
    the old dn*.lng, dn*.dlg and dn*.hlp files, because their presence can
    invalidate the language switching logic

[+] Since the old resource files can cause the quick language switching
    feature to malfunction, DN automatically checks for files names dn.dlg,
    dneng.dlg, dnrus.dlg, dn.lng, dneng.lng, dnrus.lng, dn.hlp, dneng.hlp,
    dnrus.hlp on the first start. If any are found, DN shows the list of old
    files and offers to automatically delete them. If the user refuses, the
    prompt will never appear again

[*] The "Please report to RIT" string in the fatal error message is replaced
    by "Report to RU.SHELL.DN"

[*] Reorganized the authors information shown with Alt-I in the About box;
    updated the "About Navigator and its authors" help topic

[+] New DN.INI parameter type: char, which means any single character

[+] New DN.INI parameters:

    [Interface] section:

    SystemMenuChar = long
    - The character to be used for the System Menu. Specified as the decimal
    ASCII code

    [Clock] section:

    ShowCentury = bool
    - show four digits for the year while Ctrl is held

    ShowDayOfWeek = bool
    - show day of week while Ctrl is held

    DaysOfWeek = str
    - specifies names for days of week shown while Ctrl is held, different
    from the language default. When the value is 14 or 21 characters long,
    it is considered a sequence of seven three- or four-letter names
    respectively. The names are listed without spaces, starting from Sunday,
    for instance, SunMonTueWedThuFriSat. If the parameter has some other
    arbitrary length, is left blank or omitted, the language default is used

    [Editor] section:

    AutoBracketPairs = str
    - specifies any number of bracked pairs for the AutoBrackets feature. This
    value has no effect on the bracket search feature. The default is ()[]{}<>

    [SmartPad] section:

    LineChar = long
    - specifies the delimiter character to be used by SmartPad, as its decimal
    ASCII value. The pseudographic symbol used by default (-) is not desirable
    sometimes as it is not always correctly xlated

    [Game] new section:

    EnableGame = bool
    - set this to 0 to disable the built-in Tetris game

    [Language] new section:

    ActiveLanguage = str
    - A non-empty value is taken as the current language name. For example,
    ActiveLanguage=russian specifies that rusian.* resource files should be
    used. When this value is blank or omitted, the DNLNG environment variable
    is used. And when it is not present too, English is used

    HelpLanguageOverride = str
    - A non-empty value is considered the name of the help language. For
    example, HelpLanguageOverride=english forces usage of english.hlp. When
    this value is blank or omitted, the current interface language is used for
    help. If there is no help file for that language, English help is used

    ShowLanguageMenu = bool
    - A value of 1 means that the Change Language command (or Alt-F12) must
    show a menu listing all the languages available (the list of languages
    available is retrieved by scanning the DN startup and %DNDLG% directories
    for the resource files). This behavior is convenient when there are more
    than two languages installed. The value of 0 means that the command must
    automatically cycle to the next language available without showing a menu.
    0 is the default value
